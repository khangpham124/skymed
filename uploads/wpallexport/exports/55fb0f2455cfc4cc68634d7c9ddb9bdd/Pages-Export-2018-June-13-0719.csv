When lives are on the line, the best choice is SKYMED ASIA’s aero medical flights which quickly and easily deliver patients to ground ambulances so that they may receive treatment at one of our world-class partners&#8217; hospitals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Each air ambulance flight is staffed by a highly-trained, experienced physician and an assisting nurse, both of whom are chosen to best suit the needs of the patient. Additionally, each air ambulance is equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment so that flight is an intensive care unit (ICU) in the sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to our medical staff, we employ experienced and highly-trained pilots, on-board flight coordinators and a support staff of engineers, dispatchers, and ground teams so that not only are patients and their companions given top-of-the-line care for the duration of their transportation, but the transfers are safe, smooth, and the response times for urgent cases is immediate.</p>
<p><img class=""size-medium wp-image-100 aligncenter"" src=""http://www.skymedasia.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_service03-300x211.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""211"" /><img class=""size-medium wp-image-101 aligncenter"" src=""http://www.skymedasia.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_service04-300x211.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""211"" /></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>With SKYMED ASIA, the skies save lives.</strong></p>
|<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SKYMED ASIA offers ‘medical escort’ services for patients who are in stable medical condition but are required to be under observation by a medical professional. Our medical escort service is a safe and cost-effective alternative to a traditional commercial flight: the patient is accompanied by a member of our air ambulance medical team in either first or business class on a major commercial airline.</p>
<p><img class=""wp-image-103 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://www.skymedasia.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_service06.jpg"" alt="""" width=""900"" height=""612"" /></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our Medical Management team collaborates with our Aeromedical Case Manager to ensure that the ‘commercial medical escort’ is most appropriate option for your loved one. After our team recommends this option to you, SKYMED ASIA purchases airline tickets, arranges for ground ambulance transportation and files paperwork necessary for safe, convenient travel so that you can rest easy Ultimately, SKYMED ASIA is with you every step of the way. We treat your family as our own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Prior to the flight, our medical team completes a physical assessment of the patient to ensure that they are indeed stable for commercial airline travel.</p>
<p><img class=""wp-image-104 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://www.skymedasia.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_service07.jpg"" alt="""" width=""900"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the flight, nurses and paramedics are always present, ensuring the comfort and safety of the patient during transit. They directly assist during flight check-in, security clearance, boarding and disembarking. However, that is not all: during the flight itself, the medical personnel accompanying the patient administer medications as needed, assist with meals, personal hygiene, mobility and any other care issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the flight, SKYMED ASIA ‘closes the loop’ by conducting a post-trip medical assessment and give a verbal assessment of the patient’s status upon arrival at the receiving facility, such as a hospital or medical center. Only then do we leave our patient in the capable hands of the personnel at these facilities. Our company completes and submits all the paperwork to facilitate this hand-over.</p>
|<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SKYMED ASIA arranges time-critical organ transportation for situations when it is more feasible to bring the donor organ to the recipient. Traditionally, the patient is brought to the facility where the organ is being kept. However, there are situations when it is safer to bring the organ to the patient. SKYMED ASIA’s ‘air ambulance emergency organ transport’ team transfers it to the patient in a timely fashion to preserve the integrity of the donor organ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The most commonly transplanted organs are kidneys, livers, and hearts, though we are ready and capable of transporting any donor organ to its recipient. After an organ is harvested, there is a brief window of time when an organ is ‘viable’, or able to be successfully transplanted into the recipient. This is typically between twenty-four to forty-eight hours and depends mostly on which organ is being transplanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our team works tirelessly to ensure that not only is the organ delivered to its recipient within this time frame, but that the organ is safe, intact, and ready for transplant. As with our other services, the clear choice is SKYMED ASIA for two main reasons: the first being that we are dedicated to delivering the highest quality care for our patients but, above all, we do not compromise the quality of our services for speed. Your family is our family.</p>

|<p>Cosmetic surgery is an optional that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. The number of cosmetic surgery performed has almost doubled since the start of the century. Nearly 12 million cosmetic surgeries were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. In Asia, cosmetic surgery has become more popular, and Thailand have become Asia cosmetic surgery markets.</p>
<p>In general, plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery both are often considered to be similar or the same. But medically, cosmetic surgery is a classification of plastic surgery, and it deals only with enhancing the appearance of a person using surgical as well as medical techniques. Plastic surgery, in broad terms, relates to reconstructing various body defects that may have been caused by birth disorders, diseases, burns etc.</p>
<p>“New Statistics Reflect the Changing Face of Plastic Surgery”In order to have varied cosmetic plastic surgery treatments done, most of the people prefer opting for medical tourism, as it offers them an affordable solution as well as a relaxing travel experience. What are you waiting for?</p>
